Following some guide <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V070Zmvx9AM> it had good recomendations, but I still need to cleanup the neovim setup a bitâ€¦

Added `lengedary.nvim` to setup, with `;k` it's so much easier to find where it's actually binded!

Found from <https://neovimcraft.com/>

Usefull article for collection: would be nice to setup later different setups like described here <https://michaeluloth.com/neovim-switch-configs/>

The inspirer was ThePrimagen, but I liked how @devsaslife had set it up.

So here are the links I followed:
