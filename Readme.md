# .dotfiles

Configurations are hard and tedius, perhaps it would be better to version controll them!

## Details

Keeping in `~/.dotfiles` folder I can keep setup and configuration here to share with others.

To make it work i symlink or reference to where it belongs, instead of whitelisting files from the `~` folder.

For example `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim`
